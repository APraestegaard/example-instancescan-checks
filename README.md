# Checks in this repository

## Category: Manageability

### Duplicate Script Include Name
This uses a table check to find other Script Includes having the same API name. Technically this is possible, but causes issues as there is no way to control which Script Include will be instantiated when being called.

## Category: Upgradability

## Category: Performance

### getMessage() called in Client Script 
This is a simple table check to find client scripts with use the getMessage function but do not preload messages using the Messages field. As the check does a simple contains query it could produce false-positives if the getMessage is either commented or from another library.

### Glide-API in ACL
This will check ACL rules with operation READ for usage of Glide API calls, i.e. GlideRecord and GlideAggregate as these can cause significant performance impact. s the check does a simple contains query it could produce false-positives if the getMessage is either commented or from another library.

### Cache flushed as part of scripts
This is using some advanced linter check to find usages of gs.setProperty or gs.cacheFlush. Both functions will trigger a cache flush and thus cause performance impacts. 

## Category: Security

### Tables without ACLs
This check searches for any custom table if there exists at least one ACL record. If not a finding is raised.

## Category: User Experience
